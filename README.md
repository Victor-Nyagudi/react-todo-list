# React To-do List

This is a simple React project I made while following along Traversy's tutorial on YouTube. I learned a lot in the process and hope to replicate this and maybe extend it in future.

I now have a better understanding of how React makes working with the UI more efficient using components, props, state, etc. I like it, and plan to incorporate it in future projects.

### Side Note

I think I'm in a better position using markdown, so I won't be practicing any of it inside this README. 

- [x] Improve on using markdown
- [x] Replicate this project/extend it
